          Hi, I'm Faith Koki! I’m thrilled to showcase the skills, experience, and passion I bring to the table.
          My goal? To create solutions that not only work but truly make an impact. Let’s dive in!

          Ever wondered how criminology fits into business? Think of me as your secret weapon for spotting risks, understanding people,
          and turning complexity into opportunity. I might not be solving crimes anymore, but I still bring the same sharp eye for detail 
          and strategic thinking to the table, whether it’s mitigating risks, improving workflows, or ensuring your business stays ahead 
          of the curve. Add a dash of AI and soft skills training, and you’ve got someone who can navigate challenges, streamline operations, 
          and keep things running like a well-oiled machine. Got a tricky problem or an ambitious goal? Let’s figure it out together minus the drama 
          but with all the results. 😊
